					<p>Helloo, you said you weren't going to read it :). </p>
					<!--<h1 id="approach">Approach</h1>
					<p>This is an endeavor into writing how my worldview has changed over the course of my life, but be mindful that some things can't be fully expressed in words. There&rsquo;s certainly more things that have shaped my worldview that I&rsquo;m not aware of or that I couldn&rsquo;t fit.</p>
					<p>I wrote this for a class at Brown, “The Shaping Of Worldviews”, but most importantly, to gain more self-awareness, and thus, for me. </p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s structured as a brief history of key moments and contexts in my life. Throughout the essay, I mention specific perspectives, that when clicked, expand into <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives" target="blank">generalized viewpoints</a> (don't read them right now, these life lessons are more fun to read as they come up in my story).</p>

					<h1 id="grateful">Path and Contexts</h1>
					<p>I first have to start by saying I’m extremely grateful for the circumstances of my life. I'm aware I’ve been exceptionally lucky to have been born completely healthy, into a supporting and loving family, and with access to opportunities. </p>
					<p>I don’t understand why I’ve been given the chance to carve this path in life, but I will do the best I can to live a life of use. I think <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#short-big-life" target="_blank">my life is short but I won't let it be small</a>. When things get tough, I realize I’m still an extremely fortunate person. I also see <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#adversity" target="_blank">hardships as an opportunity to learn</a>; I think trying to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#conscious" target="_blank">be more aware and conscious</a> is the most important goal for self-improvement. My motivation is gratitude paired with a drive to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#create-value" target="_blank">make a difference</a>. </p>
					<br>
					<h2 id="family-shaping">Family Shaping</h2>
					<p>Since I can remember, I’ve been excessively curious. I always poke around, ask, experiment, learn, and make, just to figure out the why of things. I would bombard my dad with hows and whys all the time, and I would always ask my mom for the reasoning behind things like why I had to share. I would never, ever settle with a “because I said so”.</p>

					<p>This was in part because my dad has always told me to never believe everything people say, including himself. He inculcated in me that although it&rsquo;s important to be open-minded, information should be filtered, and ultimately, I have to think for myself. I still ask him for recommendations on random things, but he usually comes back with &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me, do what you want&rdquo;. I love hearing people&rsquo;s perspectives and suggestions, but when I ask my dad I&rsquo;m always reminded that the person who knows most what I really want is myself. And that&rsquo;s another thing he&rsquo;s taught me: to do what I want to do, and that I can do so because I&rsquo;m literally the captain of my life.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s probably true for many people, but the two people that have influenced me the most are my parents, Gloria and Alejandro. </p>
					<p>My mom radiates happiness and love. She&rsquo;s one of the most grateful people I know and she always finds the good side of events and people. In my family we always say that &ldquo;she would lift up a rock to say hi to a cricket&rdquo;; she immediately connects with people and loves social events. I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;ve biologically inherited some of her characteristics; being able to easily connect with people has been extremely rewarding. And throughout life, she&rsquo;s also taught me to be empathetic, grateful, and self-aware. </p>

					<p>My mom has taught me to be friends with everyone; to always be nice and kind to people, because we don&rsquo;t know everyone&rsquo;s story and what they&rsquo;ve been through. Plus, friends are always helpful down the road. She&rsquo;s helped me understand that even if we don&rsquo;t agree with someone, we should <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#conscious" target="_blank">try to understand them</a>.</p>
					<p>
					But she&rsquo;s demonstrated to me that in life it&rsquo;s also important spice things up.</p>
					<blockquote>Being shrewd, perceptive, and quick-witted is critical to get what you want. </blockquote>



					<p>When I was around 11 years old, I loved playing with Beyblades (popular spinning tops at the time). We were in Canada and I knew there was a Beyblade competition so I told my parents to take me. When we got there, I had to enter my name in a raffle for a chance to participate. Since in my ID I had Valentin Matias Perez (my middle name is Matias), my mom told me to enter my name twice, one with Valentin and one with Matias. My family had always fun-teased me that I was &ldquo;justo recto&rdquo; (meaning I was all about justice and fairness), so I didn&rsquo;t want to write Matias. I wasn&rsquo;t happy but my mom ended up convincing me and we wrote both of my names. When they started calling out the names of the lucky few that could participate, I heard &ldquo;Matias Perez&rdquo;. I immediately ran and said that was me. I was super excited that I could compete, and I realized it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if it wasn&rsquo;t for my mom&rsquo;s sharpness. There are countless other situations where my mom has taught me to be savvy and now I pay special attention to find opportunities around me. </p>

					<p> My mom has a super-natural power to catch lies and understand why people do things. She&rsquo;s also one of the most sharp-eyed people I know. I think I&rsquo;m not good at lying because my mom would always see behind what I said. Although as a little kid it was frustrating sometimes, I learned to be honest. </p>

					<p>She also has an incredibly positive outlook on life. <blockquote>La vida es plena, perfecta, y completa.</blockquote>I hear my mom repeating that life is full, perfect, and complete all the time. She says we attract what we say and think, and every time something good or bad happens, she repeats the phrase. When it&rsquo;s something good it&rsquo;s to be grateful of what just happened, and when it&rsquo;s something bad it&rsquo;s to make us realize this is a learning opportunity or that something better awaits us. She is currently taking online courses and getting certificates to be a Lifestyle &amp; Health Coach; she wants to help other women love themselves and she believes she can do this through coaching on nutrition, image &amp; style, and wellness.</p>

					<p> My mom didn&rsquo;t go to college. She married my dad when she was 19 years old and my dad dropped out of college on his second year; I was born within the year. And it&rsquo;s crazy to think I&rsquo;m already over with my second year of college. One of the persons I look up to the most is my dad, and not only because he&rsquo;s my dad. My father was studying civil engineering in Colombia (the country) and although he was in Honor Roll, he realized it wasn&rsquo;t what he really liked. He dropped out and essentially became an entrepreneur. His dad wasn&rsquo;t happy he dropped out so he gave him just a little bit of money to survive but said to not come back asking for more; he&rsquo;d have to figure it out on his own. My dad worked at several places including in a factory packaging underwear and he also started several businesses like importing and selling Korean truck tires.</p>
					<blockquote>I don&rsquo;t want to depend on other people. I will live under a bridge if I have to, but I will be independent.</blockquote>

					<p>My dad would tell my mom to believe that he would find a way out. They never lived under a bridge. Several small projects, businesses, and real estate deals after, my dad decided to endeavor into the stock market. He had always been fascinated by the investing world but everyone had always told him &ldquo;that&rsquo;s too hard&rdquo;. And well, my dad likes hard things. He learned through devouring books and taking online seminars. Reading is his favorite pastime; I see him reading all the time. He&rsquo;s been learning and practicing trading for over 15 years now; and after ups and downs he now has his own hedge fund. </p>

					<p>Apart from setting an example to me on working hard, doing what you love, and thinking big, my father has taught me countless life lessons.</p>

					<p>Sometimes he would straight up tell me to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#probabilities" target="_blank">act and think with probabilities</a> because that&rsquo;s how the world works, or to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#create-value" target="_blank">be a producer more than a consumer</a>, or to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#adversity" target="_blank">be antifragile</a>.</p>

					<p>Other times he would tell me short stories to illustrate a point. He once told me a story about a guru and a man that wanted to be successful. The wise guru was meditating at the border of a fountain in his monastery and the man walked up to him. &ldquo;Guru, how can I be successful?&rdquo;, the man asked. The guru grabbed the man&rsquo;s face and shoved it into the water. The man tried to get out but the guru didn&rsquo;t let him; the guru pressed down hard and didn&rsquo;t let the man breathe. The man shook and tried pushing up violently but it was futile up until the guru finally let the man&rsquo;s head out of the water. Startled, the man asked &ldquo;Why did you do that?!&rdquo;. The guru replied, &ldquo;When you were under water, what did you want?&rdquo;. My father asked this to me too. <blockquote>I wanted to breathe!</blockquote> The guru smiled and said &ldquo;in order to be successful, you&rsquo;ve got to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#breathe" target="_blank">want it as bad as you wanted to breathe</a> when I had you underwater&rdquo;. </p>

					<p>And some other times his life lessons came in the form of challenges. I loved being challenged. The challenges weren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;I dare you to jump off a bridge&rdquo; type; their purpose was to become better at something or to try a new thing.</p>

					<p>My father once challenged me to show him in three months that I could do 100 soccer juggles (keeping the ball in the air by kicking it 100 times). My friends who were really good at soccer had records of around 100 to 150 juggles. <b>No joke, my record was 3.</b> So I didn&rsquo;t miss a single day of going out to my backyard and kicking the ball up for at least an hour, apart from my soccer practice. Two weeks in and I thought 100 juggles would be impossible. My record was 9 and it was still very, very troublesome to lift the ball from the ground with my feet. The three months passed and I showed my dad how many I could do. My father was not surprised when I reached the 100 count &mdash; he had actually expected me to complete his dare. But he was astounded when I went way beyond; I ended up doing 396. Even when I was confident I could achieve his challenge of 100 juggles, I kept practicing, improving and getting out of my comfort zone every day. I wanted to give more than what he had expected. At the time I wasn&rsquo;t aware, but this was one of the clearest instances where I subconsciously learned that <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#slope" target="_blank">a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept</a>. </p>

					<p>Mastering how to juggle a soccer ball didn't actually help me score, pass or run during a soccer game, but the process taught me that if I'm resourceful, work hard, and concentrate, I can accomplish whatever I set my mind to and go beyond. However, a week after the challenge I felt something was missing. I wasn't feeling the enthusiasm of waking up with a goal in mind or the thrill of stretching my limits. Paradoxically, I realized <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#expand-outside" target="_blank">I'm happier with myself when I leave the &quot;comfort&quot; zone</a>. Ever since that challenge, I habitually feel an urge to learn more, to go beyond specifications, and to push through my comfort zone. </p>

					<p>Another challenge from my dad consisted of running and reading The Economist.  The challenge was to: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Handwrite minimum page-long summaries of three of The Economist weekly articles, and every word that I didn&rsquo;t know the meaning of (which at that point was around 40% of the words because I was in middle school and because The Economist uses pretty complex language) I would have to look up in the dictionary, write down the definition, and try to learn it.
						<li> Run 50km in total. </li>
						<li>Do 1) and 2) every week for 20 weeks.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						 This challenge was also for my sister and my mom, but I remember I was the only one who completed it all the 20 weeks. After a few weeks I got around convincing my dad that my soccer games on Saturdays could count for 10km and that practices counted for 5km, but he didn&rsquo;t count my tennis practices.  </p>



					<p>Some other times my dad would just take me running. My mom would be worried that I would push myself too hard because she knew I would never give up and that my dad would challenge me to push harder. There was a time when my dad would wake my sister and I up at 4:40am to go running before school. All of this extra running was super helpful for soccer because it would take me a long time to get tired, but it was also a fun time with my dad. My father has always emphasized me how important exercise is. And how important is meditation and being mindful. Both my mom and my dad have shaped my thoughts on how important it is to live a balanced life. </p>

					<p> I think I&rsquo;m a self-learner, self-starter, and an entrepreneur largely because of my dad&rsquo;s influence. He&rsquo;s taught me to be relentlessly resourceful and to be independent. He always asks me &ldquo;eres cabeza de rat&oacute;n o cola de le&oacute;n?&rdquo;; I always answer &ldquo;cabeza de rat&oacute;n&rdquo; or sometimes &ldquo;cabeza de le&oacute;n&rdquo; just to tease him, but he says you have to start small. My dad has given me a huge hunger for learning and making a difference, while always reminding me the importance of humility. He regularly asks me: &ldquo;so, are you going to be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmwXdGm89Tk" target="_blank">game-changer</a>?&rdquo;</p>

					<p>I also don&rsquo;t know anyone else that can focus on things as much as my dad. My mom, sister, and I can talk literally in front of him about him when he&rsquo;s working on his computer and he won&rsquo;t realize what we just said. It&rsquo;s probably about how amazing he is at cooking or drawing. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve found a restaurant that tastes as good to me as my dad&rsquo;s signature dishes. He cooks a rack of lamb with mint jelly that is unparalleled &mdash; my dad is very attentive to details and he applies that to almost everything he does. Yet another thing I&rsquo;ve learned through him is that <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#habit" target="_blank">excellence is a habit</a>. </p>

					<p>My parents were both raised in catholic families, so religion has also had an influence in my worldview. My mom&rsquo;s high school was a convent nun school. My dad always questions the why of things so as a teenager he read a lot of books on many different religions to understand better why is it that he and his family went to church. So while I was baptised, as I grew up my dad told me that I should choose by myself what to believe in and what to practice, if at all. I did take classes for doing my first communion but it was just to learn more about catholicism. As a family we went to church a couple of Sundays but it was just a couple of Sundays; my parents wanted us to see what it was like. My dad explained to me the purpose of religions in general, how some were formed, and the good and not so necessary parts of some. He didn&rsquo;t really enjoy going to church on Sundays. He says you can believe in a higher being or the universe or however you want to call it without having to go to church. He prefers to meditate, be mindful, and exercise every day. My mom also meditates but does like to go to church every once in a while. My dad just doesn&rsquo;t like when there&rsquo;s &ldquo;herd&rdquo; mentality; he&rsquo;s taught me to question things, experiment, and be aware, not blind. I&rsquo;m agnostic about the nature of our existence, but my &lsquo;spirituality&rsquo; or growth model is <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#conscious" target="_blank">stepping up the consciousness staircase</a>.</p>

					<p>I have a sister named Susana, who I call Susy, and a funky little brother named Nicol&aacute;s who I call Pico, Nico, or Picol&aacute;s. </p>

					<p>Since I&rsquo;m only a year and a half older, Susy has been my partner in crime since we were little. We&rsquo;ve done countless pranks, played tennis, and learned together since we were little. So many of my experiences and lessons I&rsquo;ve learned with Susy by my side. She&rsquo;s also given me points of views I sometimes wouldn&rsquo;t have had. She has taught me it&rsquo;s okay to say no to things; in fact, it&rsquo;s okay to say no a lot. Like my dad, she&rsquo;s also taught me the importance of thinking for myself. She has a strong character and her friends love her I think because of her originality and independence. </p>

					<p>Up to this day, my sister and I still continue with two &ldquo;inside&rdquo; challenges when we were very little. When we were around 6 and 4.5 years old there was a time we were travelling as a family in Paris and one day as we got out of the shower, I remember we both said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold&rdquo;. We argued who was colder for a while. When we were little we had super long arguments that usually turned into fights. We continued saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still cold&rdquo; for days, even when it was clearly hot. Up until today we sometimes slip out &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still cold&rdquo;. We do the exact same thing with saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still on 2&rdquo;. We once were trying to see who could count faster and then we decided to see who could count slower. It became a slow race to count to three. We both started with &ldquo;one&rdquo;, and somehow managed to get each other to say &ldquo;two&rdquo;; we were little. Up until today, we&rsquo;re both still on 2. These type of subtle interactions express how long I&rsquo;ve known her and remind me of how many experiences we&rsquo;ve been through together. I have very few friends with similar deep-rooted expressions of connection. </p>

					<p> My little brother is 7 years old and he&rsquo;s shown me how a single person can bring light and happiness to situations. He&rsquo;s the little spark of the family. I&rsquo;m in awe of how outgoing and sociable he is. He&rsquo;s a YouTuber. I get 2-3 notifications in my phone every day of new videos he just uploaded. He&rsquo;s made me realize how much the world has changed and the direction it&rsquo;s going. He likes to build like me but instead of building physical cars or spaceships with Legos, he builds virtual worlds with Minecraft. He likes to share things with the world like me but instead of making paper airplanes or small inventions, he makes YouTube videos. He also really likes to dance and party. He&rsquo;s also helped me be more self-aware of how I was raised because I see him as a reflection of me and what things my parents teach him. I also learn by teaching him to be resourceful and to adopt a growth mindset &mdash; the idea that most abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.</p>
					<blockquote>You&rsquo;re not fixed; you can choose to grow through challenges.</blockquote>

					<p> There&rsquo;s many others members of my family that I love and have shaped my views a lot like my grandparents, uncles, and aunts, but I would have to write at least ten more pages about them. </p>

					<h4 id="rhinos">Rhinos</h4>
					<p> My father&rsquo;s favorite animal is the Rhinoceros. His second favorite is the eagle because he loves freedom, but in our family we joke we&rsquo;re a family of Rhinos. We contrast the cows and rhinos in this world. The cows graze in the pasture with the other cows, unwilling to take a chance at success, thinking that success only comes to those who are lucky, or that they just aren't cut out to be successful; many live out their lives in fear or with herd mentality. Then there are the Rhinos. These guys, unlike the cows, take full charge. Focused and unafraid, thick-skinned and unstoppable, they take massive action toward accomplishing their dreams and goals. They understand that success you can see is there for the taking, if only one has the right training, mindset, and work ethic. <strong>We ask, are you a cow lying under a tree letting life just happen to you? Or are you a determined, full-charging Rhinoceros chasing down what you want and running over every obstacle in your way? </strong></p>

					<br>
					<h2 id="mexico-cancun">M&eacute;xico y Canc&uacute;n </h2>

					 <p>I was born in Mexico City on September 7, 1995. I moved to Canc&uacute;n when I was 4, so that&rsquo;s where I say I&rsquo;m from when people ask.  </p>

					 <p>As a kid, I would literally prefer to play with sticks and stones than with actual toys. I once ripped off a helicopter blade from a Max Steel helicopter and that green blade stick was my favorite toy for a good while. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a curious maker since I can remember. I loved making my own board games, beach holes so deep or sand cities so big that people stopped to take pictures at, robots that my dog barked at and fought with, tree houses, new paper airplane designs, and compressed air potato guns that shot batteries instead of potatoes. I built with friends, I built alone, but I was always building or learning something. I built a lot of things with my best friend Santy. I&rsquo;ve also learned a lot from him. We had several entrepreneurial endeavors. We would make sushi and sell it, make brownies and sell it, fish, make ceviche and sell it, and find clothes and sell it. We&rsquo;ve also worked on projects like building iOS games and publishing them in the App Store. We lived in the same condominium in Cancun, so we&rsquo;d bike around and hang out some weekdays, and all weekends and summers. I think one of the main reasons we are such good friends is because of similarities in mindset. We believed that anything was possible and we both loved to build. <strong>No idea was too big or too crazy; we would just start it. </strong></p>

<p>I also spent a lot of my time playing sports. I learned a lot from soccer, tennis, and others, and I also made a lot of friends through them. A lot of my friends from school were also my soccer friends. A perspective particular to living in Cancun was that everyone knew most people that lived in Cancun and at the same time no one knew most of the people that you would see in restaurants, malls, or nightclubs. Tourists brought waves of people from all around the world; consistently and with peaks during summers, christmas, semana santa, and spring break. </p>

<p>You could also see real waves scaring the tourists and destroying the city when there were hurricanes. Some hurricanes felt weaker than some regular storms. Others would destroy Cancun literally to pieces and turn it into a ghost town. During hurricane Wilma you could hear windows cracking or projectiles crashing every 5 minutes. At the end, no tall, rigid palm tree survived. Only the small, flexible palm trees would stay intact. Nature&rsquo;s way of saying that to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#adversity" target="_blank">handle adversity</a>, flexibility is better than rigidness?</p>

<p>I have to say I had an extremely fun childhood and teenage years. Living in Cancun meant there were always adventures and beaches that later became a lot of parties. Many call Cancun a paradise, and I think they&rsquo;re right. I see other beaches and I honestly think they&rsquo;re ugly; the turquoise blue and white sand from Cancun has spoiled me. The underground rivers and cenotes &mdash; natural pits in the middle of the tropical jungle exposing the fresh water underground &mdash; are insanely beautiful; and they&rsquo;re super fun to jump in or zipline to. The Mayan ruins and pyramids are literally one of the 7 wonders of the world. And everyone knows Cancun for its party scene; it&rsquo;s also super hard to find parties as wild as in Cancun. </p>
<p>My friends from Cancun are probably some of the most quick-witted, sharpest, and street-smart people I know. I started going to night-clubs with my friends when I was 15-16. Even though the night-clubs are 18+, we talked our way in and eventually made friends with the bouncers. Again, I liked making things, so I made several attempts of fake ids for me and my friends; some worked. Even younger, pretty much all of my friends started smoking cigarettes when they were 13; it was the culture in Mexico. Thanks to all the outlooks from my parents about herd mentality, thinking for myself, and doing what I wanted, I never smoked a cigarette. Mexico has opened my eyes to the real world, corruption, and disparities in economic status. I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to have friends or know people in all spectrums of social or economic status. Some families have private jets. Some other families live by the day and thus don&rsquo;t have a bank account. Understanding the struggles and different circumstances has opened my eyes several times. I visited a Mayan community that had no access to light and all they had eaten ever was tortillas, beans, and chile; and they were super happy. </p>

<p>In Mexico, it&rsquo;s much more common to bribe a transit policeman than to pay for infractions; paying for tickets is usually deemed as dumb. <blockquote>El vivo vive del bobo&rdquo; pero tambi&eacute;n &ldquo;el bobo depende del vivo.</blockquote> It&rsquo;s pretty easy to get alcohol, cigarettes, or get into nightclubs underage. I realized that people in the U.S. always buckle up their seat belts in the back seats; I had never done that in Mexico. Although of course corruption and disobeying the law aren&rsquo;t good things, growing up in Mexico has shaped my worldview by realizing that rules can be broken, sometimes easily broken, and that people periodically get away with it. It&rsquo;s a pretty inadequate way of learning that the world is malleable, but it&rsquo;s still a reminder that even social or justice rules were made by humans, and that they&rsquo;re not completely untouchable; <strong>the world is malleable.</strong></p>

<br>
 <h2 id="toronto-canada">A year in Toronto, Canada</h2>
 <p> When I was in 3rd grade, my parents decided it would be a cool learning experience to move to Toronto, Canada for a year. At first, my sister and I didn&rsquo;t want to leave; we had all our friends in Cancun and none in Toronto! I was in 3rd grade and although we had English class in my school in Mexico, I barely knew English. When I got to school in Toronto, no one spoke Spanish, so I had to do hand-signals to communicate and be cunningly aware of what people said so I could say it after. Who would have guessed then, but my school in Toronto was called Brown School. It was a public school near our apartment so my sister and I walked to school every day. Fall was fine, and snow was cute when we first saw it, but Canada winter hit us in the face and froze our little ears. The change of seasons gave new colors to my worldview; Cancun was summer all year. </p>

<p> I also soon learned that the education was different. Mexico was a lot about memorization and discipline. This felt like playing and relaxing. There was literally a &ldquo;playing room&rdquo; inside our classroom. I still remember how nice and chill my professor was. Mr. Ellis built a pulley contraption around the blackboard &mdash; showing us &ldquo;how pulleys and weights worked&rdquo;&mdash; where a string held two boxes hanging on the extremes of the blackboard. One one box there was some weight. When someone did something good or answered a question right, he would give us a piece of lego so we could place it on the other box. If our box weighed enough to bring the other box up, it was &ldquo;play time&rdquo;. There were times he would give out lego pieces non-stop. I got really good at Checkers and a table-hockey game. Another difference is that in Mexico, we had never read a book in school (that wasn&rsquo;t a textbook). In Canada, I was surprised when we had to visit the school library and take out at least one book every single week. I first always chose the short, picture books. Mr. Ellis started encouraging me to try some other books and mid-year I was taking out around 3 to 4 books per week, some novels, some part of a children&rsquo;s book series, but they all had pretty small font and very few pictures. I loved The Magic Treehouse series. In Canada I learned books aren&rsquo;t actually boring &mdash; what I&rsquo;d always thought when in Mexico &mdash; and it helped me start a habit of ocassionally reading a book or two. </p>

<p> I made new friends but since I didn&rsquo;t play soccer in the afternoons here, I had way more time for myself; I became more introspective. I had more time to &ldquo;invent&rdquo; things; I got magnetic and electric circuit &ldquo;invention packs&rdquo; to build things like small solar-powered cars. I even started writing my own &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; on how to build my inventions.</p>

<p>There were several other differences in culture that gave me new perspectives. When I first went to a birthday party of one of my friends, I was surprised. We went to Chuck-E-Cheese&rsquo;s, ate some cake, and people started leaving within the hour or two. I was baffled. Birthday parties in Mexico would last the whole day. These parties didn&rsquo;t have multiple meals, inflatable pirate-ship trampolines, pi&ntilde;atas, magicians, mechanical bulls, or massive soccer games.</p>

<p>All in all, my sister and I soon realized how short-sighted we were in not wanting to live somewhere else for a year because we would miss our friends. We couldn&rsquo;t agree more that it was an amazing learning experience.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="empathy-starting">More emphasis on Empathy and Self-Starting </h2>
<p> I came back from Toronto and hanged out with all my friends from Cancun again. I played soccer again, went to school, played tennis, and invented things again. A couple of years passed. Suddenly, I started doubting my friends were actually my friends. At first I took it as a joke but after a while it was hard to accept I was actually being bullied. The reason is it did start as a joke. One of my best friends started making jokes about me, saying I was a &ldquo;topo&rdquo;, which meant mole, and a &ldquo;teto&rdquo;, which meant boring, foolish, kind of like the cows I described that differ from the rhinos; I don&rsquo;t know if it was because he had confidence issues, he was having some problems at home, or he was envious of me. Then he turned all of my other friends to do the same. The infuriating thing was that only what I thought was my group of friends followed his jokes. During recess at school, my friends sat to eat lunch at a table and once I was about to sit, they would stand up and move to another table. It could&rsquo;ve been funny once or twice but they just didn&rsquo;t stop doing it; and everyone moved and left me alone. Shortly after, my friends stopped inviting me to their houses on weekends. Before this I had always hung out with friends on weekends but now I felt avoided; everything was sudden so I felt it as an abrupt change. Once, when we were playing soccer during recess at school, this friend that had started all of this challenged me. He knew I was pretty bad at scoring goals because I had always been defense. He said, I bet this guy (a kid that unfortunately fit who we would call a teto) can score more goals than you over three recesses. Everyone then wanted to see who would score more. The loser would have to shave his hair completely. The kid was one of the worst around at soccer so I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t lose. Then as we started playing, all my &lsquo;friends&rsquo; played intentionally so that I would lose. They would take the ball from me and pass it and leave it in front of the net so the other kid could push it in. I couldn&rsquo;t pass the ball to anyone; everyone was on the other team. I lost. I was going to keep my word, so the next day I came to school bald. I somehow felt my shaved hair as a metaphor of how I had been degraded. I continued to be bullied for around six or eight months. I could now really understand the power of words, mindset, and the influence people can have on others. I learned a lot about empathy. My dad suggested I should show more initiative and be self-starter. Gradually, I got out of this stumbling block by being the one who planned events, by inviting more friends to play at home, and by communicating more to my friends so they realized how the situation had come to be. After everything was back to normal, it turned out that my &lsquo;friend&rsquo; who had started this moved to another city. When we saw each other again a couple years after it seemed like nothing had happened and we were, and are, friends again. Although not fun while it happened, this was an instance where I can see how hardships are opportunities to learn. I&rsquo;m now super mindful of the power of words and how they can affect other people, or yourself if you accept and believe them; and I now understand people and empathy better. Since then I&rsquo;ve also had the habit of being an organizer, self-starter, planner; bringing people together and creating opportunities.  </p>

<br>
<h2 id="travelling">Travelling</h2>

	<p> Experiencing new cultures, eating new foods, and meeting new people is very fun. Travelling has expanded my worldviews many times. I&rsquo;m very grateful I&rsquo;ve been able to travel to many places around the world. I&rsquo;ve visited Europe around five times, over a dozen cities in the U.S., half a dozen cities in Canada, five countries in Latin America, and road tripped from Mexico City to Cancun and all around Cancun, and I always learn something new from travelling. I have yet to visit many continents and scenes. The world is vast but I hope to continue to understand it better through travel. </p>

<br>
<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>

<p>  Being active, exercising, and playing sports has been a fundamental part of my life. My parents have always emphasized the importance of exercising and of living a balanced life physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually. Sports have also been a source of tangible examples of incredible life lessons and have exposed me to many different people, teams, and perspectives. They&rsquo;ve also helped me experience losing, winning, and tying thousands of times. Since I was very little I&rsquo;ve played soccer and tennis &mdash; usually at the same time and sometimes one or the other, but both pretty equally overall throughout my life. I&rsquo;ve also dabbled with some other sports and types of exercise. </p>

<h4 id="soccer">Soccer</h4>
<p> I&rsquo;ve played in over 6 different soccer clubs. Since I was little I played in my school&rsquo;s soccer team, several soccer clubs in Cancun including Atlante, summer training camp teams, and my boarding school soccer team. Sometimes we would win Cancun&rsquo;s soccer league, some other times we would lose really dumb games. Other times, our team went to Disney&rsquo;s International Youth Soccer Tournament and won 3rd place. Soccer really stressed to me the importance of teamwork and camaraderie. Only when there was true team spirit and collaboration would we perform better than the sum of our parts. I also learned to be <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#grit" target="_blank">gritty</a> as hell; I had a coach that would scream at us to &ldquo;be dogs&rdquo; and push harder; no matter if it was the final of the world or just another practice, we would have to give it all we had. </p>

<h4 id="tennis">Tennis</h4>
<p>Mentality is equally or more important than your skills. Through tennis, I&rsquo;ve learned that no matter how good you are, if your mind is unfocused or depressed, then you will perform bad and very likely will lose. In tennis, all you depend on is yourself; it&rsquo;s much more a fight against yourself than the other player. I&rsquo;ve been through crazy comebacks or abrupt losses in tournaments or single games. At a tournament in Cancun, I had gotten to the final, but this day I was losing. We both had similar skills, but the other player was conceivably better than me. I was losing by two tennis sets, and he was about to get the last one. He had the game, set, match, &amp; championship point. 6 times. At these moments it&rsquo;s very easy to slide and give in, but I kept my head up, kept calm, and had the mindset that I could still win. I ended up turning the game around and winning. The same thing happened at several other games and I managed to get a couple of tournaments, merely because I was usually mentally more stable. <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#attitude" target="_blank">Attitude</a> is pretty important, more than aptitude to certain extent. That being said, tennis also taught me the importance of <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#slope" target="_blank">deliberate practice</a>. </p>

<h4 id="snowboard-others">Snowboard &amp; others</h4>

 When I was little and I first tried snowboard, I said that my three favorite sports were snowboard, soccer, and tennis, even though I had barely snowboarded. I&rsquo;ve snowboarded more &mdash; but still not a huge amount &mdash; and I still say those are my favorite sports. The feeling of freedom gliding down a humongous mountain while witnessing spectacular views is unparalleled. From living in Cancun, I&rsquo;ve also had the chance to do a bit of surfing, windsurf, kitesurf, wakeboard, and triathlons. All these geographic-specific sports also remind me how different circumstances give or prevent different opportunities. Then I also just run or workout. My dad took me running a lot and we would usually also do pull ups. I&rsquo;ve come to really enjoy workouts that are very intense, and I recently discovered a class in New York, Tone House, that most of the times I&rsquo;ve been, I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where I have to throw up, but then I keep going. </p>

 <p>I like that sports and exercise allow for a very palpable way to stretch my limits by getting out of my comfort zone, improve through deliberate practice, handle adversity, practice grit, realize that a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept, or even remind me that if I'm going to do something, I might as well give it all.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="summer-camps">Summer Camps</h2>

<p> I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to be able to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#do-what-you-love" target="_blank">do what I love</a> and discover new experiences during summers. A big component of my summers have been summer camps or summer sessions. </p>
<h4 id="summer-sessions">Summer sessions</h4>
<p> Since I was little, my parents have encouraged my sister and I to get out of bed asap in the mornings. This was easy when we had school and when it was summer we were usually in some sort of summer session. Several were mostly playing, some were tennis summer sessions, others were soccer, and some others were to prepare for triathlons. My parents always encouraged us to wake up early, shower, and start being <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#create-value" target="_blank">active and productive members of society</a>. This urgency established my sense that <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#short-big-life" target="_blank">life is too short to be small</a>.  </p>

<h4 id="village-camps">Village Camps</h4>
<p>  Similar to the time my parents wanted to go to Toronto for a year but my sister and I didn&rsquo;t want to, going to Switzerland for a 4 week summer camp seemed very scary. I was about ten years old and my sister was eight. Apart from practicing tennis, learning french, and doing &ldquo;outdoor adventure&rdquo; in the mountains, we also met other kids from all over the world. We had a lot of fun and learned to be more independent.  Camp Hilltop  Experimenting, making new friends, learning, and being happy. A year after going to Village Camps with my sister and realizing how great of an experience it was, we went to Camp Hilltop in the outskirts of New York. This was the classic movie summer camp with a lake and campfires and rope courses and more activities that you could imagine. I also went with two of my best friends from Cancun, Yankel and Santy. I&rsquo;m very grateful to have a happy and fun childhood and that I could experience the importance of relaxing, unwinding, and <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#experience-purpose" target="_blank">enjoying life</a>. </p>

<h4><a href="#a-star-math">A-Star Math Camp</a></h4>

<h2 id="awakening-education">Awakening on Education</h2>
<p>Up until my sophomore year of high school in Canc&uacute;n, I hadn&rsquo;t really put thought into how important it would be for me to attend a great college if I really wanted to be a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo;. I had heard about Harvard and MIT only from movies or from Wikipedia pages (I saw that Tony Stark from Iron Man had gone to MIT and Bill Gates to Harvard), but I didn&rsquo;t know of other good colleges or much else about universities in general. Then I did some research and learned there was a thing called the Ivy League. Then I had a realization that I really wanted to go to the best school I could; I realized it would help a lot for my dream of being &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo;. I was relieved that I had always been really good at school; I was the best at my school in Cancun, but that was only thanks to my habit of no matter what I did, I always tried to do the best I could; and because I had really good memory and actually liked learning. However, I realized that was probably not enough. I knew almost no one that had gone to college in the U.S. and the only person from my school in Cancun I knew of that had been accepted to one (or even just applied) was 2 years older than me and he also had fame for being super smart. When some teachers told me I was brilliant they would usually refer to him too. Gabriel and I were friends from soccer but we unfortunately didn&rsquo;t interact much because of the year difference and because he left to a &ldquo;boarding school&rdquo; in the U.S. at the beginning of high school. Gabo told me his school was a magical place where people actually loved learning and there were boundless opportunities like student clubs and arts and a lot of sports and it was easier to get into a good U.S. college from there. Also, you had a say over what classes you took, which sounded incredible because I had always had to take the same classes as everyone in my year. I wanted to go. I saw it as a really close and crucial stepping stone to get a better education and get to where I&rsquo;d want to be. He went to Phillips Academy Andover and he and the internet said it was one of the top boarding schools in the U.S. He had started a non-profit while at Andover that built middle schools around the Cancun Mayan area and I saw that as out-of-this-world incredible. He said there were around 8 of these really good &ldquo;New England Boarding Prep Schools&rdquo; and I saw that the time to apply for next year&rsquo;s school year was almost over. My parents supported me wanting to go, but thought I should apply next year because I only had around 3 weeks to get everything together. I really wanted to go as soon as possible and my urge increased when I read from these schools&rsquo; websites that they accepted only a few juniors and that they didn&rsquo;t accept seniors. I really wanted to go that next year and be a junior, there was no other option. I managed to write some essays, get some recommendations, take the SSAT (this is when I learned the SAT also existed), get interviewed, and submitted my applications to Andover and Deerfield. Then I had a bit more time to apply to Northfield Mount Hermon and write what I thought were better essays &mdash; I actually didn&rsquo;t know anything about essays; I had never written an &ldquo;essay&rdquo;; the most I had to write in my school in Cancun was short summaries of things or make a cardboard for a presentation.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get into Andover nor Deerfield. I thought &ldquo;damn, I shouldn&rsquo;t have sent that picture of trophies&rdquo;. I never doubted myself, but I knew that my SSAT scores weren&rsquo;t particularly good, my essays were probably bad, and I realized I may have appeared as arrogant; I had a lot of trophies, diplomas, medals, and awards from tennis and soccer competitions, a bunch of math/spelling bee contests from school, and diplomas saying I had the highest GPA at school, 9.9/10, etc., so I put them all together and sent a picture. I did realize that might have been egotistic so I didn&rsquo;t do the same thing for NMH. </p>

<p>I was extremely grateful I got in and had the opportunity to go to NMH. It actually turned out to be a great outcome because my best friend Santy had also applied and was going with me. And Gabo&rsquo;s brother, who was a year younger than us was also coming to NMH. I was ready to give everything I could. </p>

<p>I did some research and learned that in the U.S., high school sophomores usually took Algebra 2 and juniors took Precalculus. The system in Mexico was a little different; we had seen the first concept or two from Algebra 2 but with what we knew Santy and I were supposed to go into Algebra 2 at NMH. I didn&rsquo;t know how to find slopes of lines so I asked my Math teacher from school about it and he didn&rsquo;t know either; he told me he thought there was a formula and he would confirm the next day. I didn&rsquo;t want to be behind, so I lied and said I knew Algebra 2 so they could put me in Precalculus. I asked another teacher from the American school in Cancun to teach me Algebra in 2 weeks. It was summer so I had some time to learn before I left to a Math Camp. &quot;You know Math camp is the nerdiest thing there is, right?&rdquo;, this American Math teacher told me. Math was my favorite subject at school and I wanted to learn more about it; I realized that I would have to be really good at something if I wanted to go to a great university and be a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo;. At the moment I was also super intrigued with Quantum Mechanics because I had seen some YouTube videos and documentaries about it, but I thought Math was a great starting point. So knowing how much fun I had had at other summer camps, I googled &ldquo;summer camps for math&rdquo;. I had never heard of Math camps and my parents hadn&rsquo;t either. I found one that I liked in California and to apply I had to solve some Math puzzles I thought were super fun but found pretty hard. </p>

<h4 id="a-star-math">A-Star Math Camp</h4>

<p> A-Star Math camp in California really did change my life &mdash; my eyes were popped open and I became aware of many things. Math had always been the easiest piece of cake for me. Yet on my first day of classes at this camp, I felt as if the teacher was talking to me in Chinese, or a language I had never even heard of. The camp&rsquo;s focus was &lsquo;competition math&rsquo; for &lsquo;mathletes&rsquo;, phrases I had never heard before, and I found them hilarious. Our teachers were all International Math Olympiad winners, some were 4-time gold medalists. In four weeks, we would learn about Number Theory, Algebra Analysis, Geometry, and Combinations and Permutations. I learned things like how to find the smallest number that if you switch its first digit with its last one, the new number would be exactly 54 times bigger. I had never seen this type of Math before and finally there was more than just plugging and chugging into a formula; in these problems you actually had to think hard. And they required a lot of creativity to solve. </p>

<p> My roommates were from Turkey, Spain, and Pennsylvania. They were all in higher-level classes than me. I was shocked when I saw that some kids that were three years younger than me were in classes two levels higher than mine; I had always had to go at the same pace in Mexico. I just had never thought of that. I had also seen that U.S. movies depicted Asians as super smart and now I knew why. I thought I was already super behind and that at the pace these other kids were learning it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to catch up. However, I fell in love with problem solving. I wanted to get better so I ordered two books one of my roommates recommended, The Art of Problem Solving I and yes, The Art of Problem Solving II. After our 5 hours of classes per day, I would try to solve problems from these books. I was basically doing Math all day long because the other activities at this camp were also puzzles and Math challenges in teams. We also played ultimate frisbee and this was where I shined; my friends here usually told me I was pretty cool. </p>

<h4 id="code"> Discovered Coding</h4>

<p> Then one of our Math teachers said he would teach a short workshop series on &ldquo;C++&rdquo;. I asked, and learned that C++ was the name of a &lsquo;programming language&rsquo;. I soon realized that I could learn how to program games, or websites, or a Facebook. I was shown it was an amazing tool for problem solving. <blockquote>I immediately thought, wow, this is a very fun and effective way to create things and share them with the world.</blockquote> Then I decided  that creating things through code was <a href="become-good">something I wanted to become really good at</a>. I was excited because I could quickly see tangible results by creating things. So after this Math camp, I decided to spend the rest of my summer learning how to program. It was time to select what courses I would take my first fall at NMH and I saw they had &ldquo;Intro to Java&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advanced Placement Computer Science&rdquo;. Since I wanted to get good fast, I wanted to go straight to AP CS. However, it had &ldquo;Intro to Java&rdquo; as a requirement, or significant previous experience demonstrated by submitting a project. I had no idea what Java was, but I decided to say I knew Java and to try to submit a project before the deadline. The deadline was in 3 weeks so it was learning time. I devoured all of &quot;TheNewBoston&quot; YouTube tutorial series about Java (over 90 videos) by watching 3-4 hours each day. I would&rsquo;ve watched more but I also wanted to hang out with friends and family in the afternoons; it was summer in Cancun. I built and submitted a Tic Tac Toe on time.</p>

<h2 id="nmh">Northfield Mount Hermon</h2>
<p> Living on a campus where learning and growing as a person are the main objectives was a dream come true for me (and continues to be at Brown). I was happy people around me also loved learning; I wasn&rsquo;t the exception now. I was able to delve into the subjects I'm passionate about, like Computer Science and Math, but I also stumbled on courses so eye-opening that I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get to class and discuss what I discovered in last night's reading, like American Literature and The Future, a literature class on utopias and dystopias. I had no idea that authors yelled things beneath their words; in Mexico I had never interpreted a book, and here I discovered it was as an extremely fascinating, fun, and creative endeavor.</p> <p>NMH has stretched my limits to unimaginable extents. I cleaned horse shit! We had weekly 4-hour &lsquo;workjob&rsquo;, a mandatory job to give back to the school. I picked up quarts of raspberries (and ate a third of them), I stacked cords of wood, and I raked cow stalls. At first, I thought it was pretty annoying to scrub the sticky grease on the kitchen's floor and I knew that some of my friends from Cancun would try to do anything to get out of it, but after a while I realized that NMH was so much more than a school; they were educating us for the &ldquo;heart, head, and hand&rdquo;. True to its mission, NMH empowered us to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#create-value" target="_blank">act with humanity and purpose</a>.</p>

<p>And when I first stepped foot on campus, I was amazed by how many opportunities surrounded me; I wanted to try them all. In Cancun, my school didn&rsquo;t have a single student club. At NMH, I became a Math tutor and an International Ambassador, joined the Math Team, Debate Society, and the Science Club, became Class Treasurer, became a Resident Leader, played Varsity Soccer, Varsity Tennis, and got some school awards including Cum Laude. NMH welcomed me to be all I could be and encouraged me to be a bit more.</p>

<p>Although NMH could only satiate my thirst for Computer Science my first semester with AP CS, I didn&rsquo;t stop learning; I started taking online courses and building projects, like an iOS app for NMH. When I was applying to colleges my top choices were Stanford, MIT, and Brown. I had visited MIT, hadn&rsquo;t visited Stanford, but when I visited Brown, I felt it was <a href="http://valentinperez.com/why-brown" target="_blank">especially my type</a>. After some thought I decided to apply Early Decision. Honestly, after my decision, I did get &ldquo;fear of missing out&rdquo; from Stanford or MIT, and thoughts sometimes still cross my mind. I really wanted to go to one of the three, so I thought applying early to one of them could give me more chances. Since MIT didn&rsquo;t let internationals apply early, I hadn&rsquo;t visited Stanford, and I fell in love with Brown when I visited, I decided to go with Brown. </p>

<p>My dad teased me by saying that I probably had good grades in Cancun only because school there was easy. But at NMH he couldn&rsquo;t say that anymore; I was astounded by the amount of work we had and how smart some of my peers were. They also came from all over the world and the U.S. Regardless, I kept <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#habit" target="_blank">trying to always give my best</a>. I soon realized that it wasn&rsquo;t just Cancun and I gained more confidence when I got a 98 in the AP Calculus BC final my second semester. The average was a 73 and all my friends in the class were extremely smart; only a few would be allowed to take BC Calc. Next year when I was taking Multivariable Calculus I realized that not even two years ago I had no idea how to find slopes of lines. I very clearly noticed that <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#slope" target="_blank">a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept</a>. Also two years ago I didn't know I could <i>learn</i> how to program, and there I stood having made around a dozen iOS apps ranging from games to an app a laundry company in Pennsylvania paid me to do, to NMH&rsquo;s official iOS app; 5 were in the AppStore and Gravity Monkey had even been ranked #1 in the U.S. store for adventure and for arcade games. I had taken courses online on Machine Learning and Computational Investing and I'd also made a couple of websites, dabbled with about a dozen programming languages, and taught others how to program through workshops. Unrelated to code, but related to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#why" target="_blank">what I believed in</a>, I also created a workshop on NMH &ldquo;Diversity Day&rdquo; on how to think different.</p>

<h4 id="harvard-summer">Harvard Summer </h4>
<p>Like the previous summer that I had learned so much in Math Camp, I wanted to learn more, this time about computer science. I couldn&rsquo;t find many &ldquo;programming summer camps&rdquo; but I saw that Harvard offered a Summer Course on &ldquo;Building Mobile Applications&rdquo;. I also enrolled on a class called &ldquo;Spaces, Mappings, and Mathematical Structures&rdquo;, where we basically learned how to write proofs by learning some Abstract Algebra and Topology. &quot;This is too abstract and hard; it doesn't have any use!&rdquo; complained Ivan, a Harvard CS major that became my friend and was also taking this &ldquo;Abstract&rdquo; Algebra class. It was 5am and we were in a classroom we found open in the science center working on our problem set. The next day, in the middle of our &quot;Mobile Apps&quot; class, we both turned to each other with a face of surprise. Our next project required the use of &quot;equivalence classes&quot;, something we had just learned in our seemingly too abstract class. My mobile apps project used equivalence classes, and I also learned to see how my algorithm was using Set Theory &mdash; another thing I learned in the &quot;abstract&quot; class. I realized that <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#experience-purpose" target="_blank">no matter how abstract or unrelated something seems, you can apply it to something else in life</a>.</p>

<h4 id="mit-launch-summer">MIT Launch Summer</h4>
<p> The goal is to learn all the skills and mindset needed to start a company, then design and launch one &mdash; all within a month.</p>

<p> After the Harvard summer iOS course and several more online courses, tutorials, and googling, I had acquired the skills necessary to build iOS apps but I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether I knew how to start a real company. I&rsquo;m not a U.S. citizen so I didn&rsquo;t have a tax ID and thus couldn&rsquo;t charge for my iOS apps or put ads in them, so my dad had helped me incorporate my own company, Valpe Technologies, LLC. But I wanted to learn more about entrepreneurship, startups, best methods, and how to properly start one (I&rsquo;ve now realized there is no &lsquo;proper&rsquo; way). So for my next summer, I decided to go to MIT Launch, an entrepreneurship summer program for high school students.</p>

<p> It was one of the most incredible, roller-coaster-intense experiences I&rsquo;ve had. Our teachers were Harvard and MIT MBAs, and they said they condensed the most important parts of what they had learned into a 4-week curriculum. We also had talks by successful entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship professors, and motivational speakers; this is where I learned the term <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#adversity" target="_blank">Adversity Quotient</a>. Then we started 2-3 small projects with teams, so we could then design, build, and launch our real company within the month. I don&rsquo;t know how, but I think I averaged 4 hours of sleep per night; I was the only one who knew how to code in our 4 person team and I was also always present in all our brainstormings and discussions, and in most of our customer interviews and partnership talks. We were all high school students &mdash; one from Ukraine, another from Chicago, and two from Mexico. We all hated waiting in lines, so we built endLine &mdash; an iOS app so you could pre-order and pre-pay for coffee and skip the lines. We thought coffee was the perfect first niche market since people usually ordered their same coffee at their same times, and having to wait in line was a boring halt to their busy daily routine. I built the app and submitted to the AppStore. We raised a small but successful Indiegogo campaign and had three independent coffee shops in Boston basically signed up with us when the app would be accepted by Apple&rsquo;s appstore. The whole process was a roller-coaster ride though. Amid the whole process, Square released their Square Orders app, which was for pre-ordering and pre-paying food, and we heard rumors that Starbucks had plans for building an app to pre-order their coffee. I&rsquo;ve now learned that competitors shouldn&rsquo;t be a big source of worry, if at all, but at that moment we were pretty taken aback. We still planned to continue tough. But once the summer was over and we all were back in our high schools, or college for me, we couldn&rsquo;t sync well and we decided to give endLine a break that hasn&rsquo;t ended. I also met incredible, entrepreneurially-minded friends that up to today I still regularly talk with or Skype.</p>

<h2 id="online-courses">Online Courses</h2>
<p> I&rsquo;ve realized that most &ldquo;game changers&rdquo; are autodidacts. I try to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#everyone-else" target="_blank">live life like it&rsquo;s the last day for everyone else</a> and learn as if I&rsquo;ll live forever. Watching my dad learn from books and online seminars has also deeply influenced my perspective on education. I usually learned things from YouTube, and then, when I wanted to keep learning about programming after AP Computer Science at NMH, I discovered Coursera and edX. These were two pretty new platforms where universities taught courses online, for free. I thought this was incredible and I could feel the upheaval undergoing in online education. It helped reinforce the idea that software is eating the world. I&rsquo;ve now taken and tested countless courses, workshops, and seminars in all these emerging platforms like Udacity, Skillshare, Coursera, Udemy, edX, and YouTube. I&rsquo;ve learned a bit of many things, ranging from Typography to Nuclear Science to Quantum Computing.</p>

<p>Below is a pic of what I planned to learn during my high school junior-year summer. </p>
<img id="summer-study-pic" src="img/summer-study-2013.png"></img>
<p>In the picture above, the first five courses out of the eight were online. At the moment I thought my plan was doable, but I learned it was a bit too ambitious. I didn&rsquo;t study for the SAT at all, I read half of the books listed, and the courses marked as ****MAIN PRIORITY ** or **IMPORTANT *** were probably the ones in which I did the least, if watching 3-4 videos even count for something. This still happens to me when I try to schedule one of my &ldquo;productive AF Sundays&rdquo;. But although it can feel upsetting when only half the work gets done, I still like to shoot for the moon. </p>

 <p> Another time, when it was my first winter break at NMH, I tried taking &ldquo;Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation&rdquo; from Berkeley in edX. Linear Algebra was a prerequisite so I was also trying to learn that at the same time. Around three weeks in I decided to drop it and take &ldquo;Computational Investing&rdquo; by Georgia Tech in Coursera instead &mdash; as you can imagine, my curiosity had me trying out course after course. I also realize that knowing that my dad liked the stock market influenced my decision to try it out. Knowing Python was a prerequisite and I didn&rsquo;t know Python, but I didn&rsquo;t drop this one. Here I tried Coursera&rsquo;s &ldquo;verified certificates&rdquo; feature so I finished it all. Then, mid this course and mid Junior Spring semester at NMH, I started &ldquo;Machine Learning&rdquo; by Stanford on Coursera too. I was intrigued by Artificial Intelligence and I wanted to see if I could handle an advanced undergrad/grad level Computer Science topic. The course was hard and required a lot of self-discipline &mdash; it was 11 weeks so it also intersected with the first few weeks of my summer classes at Harvard, and school finals &mdash; but I finished and did well. </p>

<p> I&rsquo;ve also learned countless things from online articles and essays. Learning online is probably one of my favorite pastimes. When I feel burned out, I read online articles.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;m also a bit psycho, but I discovered audiobooks a bit over 2 years ago and realized I could learn while walking, doing laundry, running, or while doing other activities that don&rsquo;t require much focus. For a bit over two years, I&rsquo;ve been able to read around 2-3 books per week. The other part that may sound more psycho is that I listen to them at 3x the speed, but I swear that after a while you get used to the speed and feel like 1x is slow motion &mdash; that&rsquo;s the trick because books are 9 hours in average so this turns them to 3 hours listening time and with an hour per day you can comfortably finish a book in 3 days. I&rsquo;m addicted to learning, and book titles, reviews, or recommendations always tempt me to be exposed to more and more perspectives. Some concepts in the books might be refreshers, but there are many fresh ideas that have stretched my mind.</p>

<h2 id="brown">Brown</h2>
<p> I see the Brown community as very interesting people brought together so we can learn from one another. There are <a href="">many reasons</a> why I think Brown was for me. I understand why some call it the &ldquo;the happiest college on earth&rdquo;. Brown has shaped my worldview by emphasizing to me the importance of collaboration, it has encouraged me to be multidisciplinary, I&rsquo;ve become more independent and creative because of the Open Curriculum, and I&rsquo;ve learned an immense amount from my teachers and friends. </p>

<h4 id="classes"> Classes</h4>
<p>
 I&rsquo;m concentrating in Computer Science and Applied Math study Computer Science, but I also take courses from many other subjects, because I take what&rsquo;s interesting to me. I usually think: would I enjoy this, would it give me new skills, or could it give me a new perspective? I try to take courses or get involved in things for which the answer is yes. I&rsquo;ve been able to delve deep into CS and Math (all the time I feel how a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept &mdash; in just my second semester, I had to build a Google Maps from scratch); I&rsquo;ve been able to explore amazing courses that have opened my eyes such as The Shaping of Worldviews (this one), Skepticism &amp; Knowledge, or Creative Non-Fiction; and I&rsquo;ve even been allowed to create courses of my own, like Lucid Dreaming.</p>

<h4 id="more-than-classes">More than classes</h4>
<p> My worldview has arguably been shaped more by people, teams, events, clubs, dining halls, houses, and serendipity than by classes. I can&rsquo;t explain all of them, but below are three families at Brown that have greatly shaped my perspectives. </p>

<h4 id="brown-ep">Brown Entrepreneurship Program </h4>
<p>Before I came to Brown, I knew I wanted to be involved with entrepreneurship and the startup culture. My first semester I joined Brown EP&rsquo;s &ldquo;Innovation Dojo&rdquo;, a semester-long introduction to entrepreneurship and innovation, and shortly after, I decided to join the team of Brown EP, the student-run entrepreneurship initiative on campus. This semester I became the Co-President, and I&rsquo;ve learned an insane amount from the whole process and my team. I&rsquo;ve been exposed to new perspectives, people, and decisions from which I&rsquo;ve learned more about how to handle adversity, the importance of <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#clouds-and-dirt" target="_blank">Clouds and Dirt</a>, <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#upwind" target="_blank">Going Upwind</a>, <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#create-value" target="_blank">being a lifter</a>, the importance of <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#do-what-you-love" target="_blank">doing what you love</a>, and <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#why" target="_blank">starting with why</a>. </p>

<h4 id="hack-at-brown"> Hack@Brown</h4>
<p> I attended the first Hack@Brown as a high-schooler and decided to join the organizing team right when I got to campus. Hack@Brown was my first hackathon and it got me one in love with hackathons &mdash; I was introduced to the idea that if you <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#breathe" target="_blank">really wanted</a>, you could build amazing projects that create value in a single weekend. It reinforced even more the idea that a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept. I can&rsquo;t be thankful enough for the team behind Hack@Brown; I&rsquo;ve learned an immense amount from everyone. I&rsquo;ve been to around 8 hackathons and I haven&rsquo;t seen an event with a higher attention to detail and care to the participants. I&rsquo;ve learned again that <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#habit" target="_blank">excellence is a habit</a> and to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#why" target="_blank">act with a purpose</a>.  </p>
<h4 id="buxton">Buxton International House </h4>
<p>Living in a house with people from Greece, Italy, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Venezuela, India, the United Kingdom, China, and from most corners of Earth means I&rsquo;ve been able to get a glimpse of worldviews from all around the world. I&rsquo;ve learned to understand perspectives or struggles I wasn&rsquo;t aware of, and ultimately my family from Buxton has helped me <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#conscious" target="_blank">step up the consciousness staircase</a>.</p>

<h2 id="freshman-summer">Freshman Summer</h2>
<p> Last summer I got a taste of the startup world in NYC. I was part of the hackNY Fellowship, a program whose mission is to connect exciting students to each other and introduce them to mentors, big ideas, and interesting people in New York City. They also pair us with a startup where we intern for the summer. I asked to be paired with an early stage startup so I could learn closely from the founder, have bigger responsibilities and impact, and get a taste of what it felt to be in the early stages of a startup; I was looking to <a href="http://valentinperez.com/perspectives#slope" target="_blank">optimize for learning</a>. </p>

<h4 id="matchbook">Matchbook</h4>
<p> I was expecting a 10-20 person startup but I knew I was on for a wild experience when I found out the team was two developers, (including the founder), a business guy, and me. I interned at Matchbook, a startup that through an iOS app lets you remember the places you love and want to try, kind of like how before people would take a matchbook from a restaurant so that they could remember it later. Our office was in the co-working space of the Venture Capital firm that funded Matchbook, and our desks were right in front of Pedro&rsquo;s office, the VC, which was basically also part of the team; he was like another co-founder. Gustavo, the iOS engineer and Pedro were both from Venezuela. Jared was the other engineer, co-founder, and he had been a hackNY fellow like 5 years ago. Marc was the business guy; he was the Director of Partner Relations. We were all foodies. The startup was basically an app for keeping tab of restaurants you love or want to try so you can imagine how pumped I was when every day we would go out for lunch to find restaurants we loved. Our Matchbook lunch favorites were Tacombi, Num Pang, Go go curry, Hummus &amp; Pita Co., Digg In, Tres Carnes, and Ashby's. I came in an interesting time for Matchbook. They were struggling to monetize and they only had money for until the end of the summer. So we worked on a new aspect of the business: selling restaurant unique experiences, which was basically a special dish exclusive to Matchbook users. Marc would bike around New York City every day visiting restaurants to try to partner. Jared, Gustavo, and I worked on the tech side and mid-summer we launched &ldquo;Matchbook restaurant unique experiences&rdquo;. We sent an email update to 10,000+ Matchbook users in NYC but I was heartbroken when I saw the stats. Only one person bought an experience. We went through this around 4 more times and the results were pretty bad. I could feel how hard it must&rsquo;ve been to been working on something for two years and the last hopes of being able to continue slip away. When I finished my summer internship, it wasn&rsquo;t only the end for me, but for the team to work on Matchbook full-time. Jared and Gustavo would just maintain the app as a side-hobby after summer. Nevertheless, I still learned an insane amount every day about best software engineering practices, Swift, and Objective-C. I also played around with the MongoDB database and had to learn a bit of Ruby on Rails because I re-made the frontend website. I also discussed and learned about business strategies and growth techniques. Specific things I worked on the app were a new restaurant menu navigation system, a smart settings/permissions page with animations, and an inspiration feed. </p>

<h4 id="hackNY">hackNY Community</h4>
<p> Living and hacking with an amazing community of 33 other super cool fellows, plus meetups with previous hackNY alums made for a memorable summer. We all interned at startups all around NYC but we all lived together in NYU&rsquo;s dorms. </p>

<p>We were basically exposed to the startup world in NYC through talks by leaders in the tech community, interning at a startup, and living &amp; hacking with an amazing community of 33 other super cool fellows. hackNY is based on the premise that when smart and ambitious people are brought together, exciting things happen. The first day, Chris and Evan, the hackNY founders explained that this is how Silicon Valley was formed, and hackNY is an attempt to build a similar builder community, but with the power and diversity of NYC. </p>

<p>From the speaker series I got the chance to get to know busy and accomplished leaders in the tech community better than I could&rsquo;ve expected; none of the events were rushed, there was plenty of time for Q&amp;A, and these leaders usually shared off-the-record tales and firsthand accounts of the dot-com boom. I took a bunch of notes and an example of something I became aware of is when the Codecademy founders told us that people usually people have two ways at looking at life, either that life is about experiences or that life is about purpose. I thought about it after we talked with them and came up with a combination. </p>

<p>I also learned a lot from late-night chats with my new hackNY friends and even workshops we taught each other; I taught a &ldquo;Do you even Swift?&rdquo; iOS workshop. What&rsquo;s more incredible about the hackNY community is that it extends way beyond just summer. We have a Slack (messaging platform for teams) with alumNY that is active every day; there&rsquo;s over 80 channels for people to interact with people with similar &mdash; or different &mdash; interests, and there&rsquo;s always someone willing to help out with coding questions, job opportunities, or moving into a new city. </p>

<h4 id="apple-wwdc">Apple WWDC 2015</h4>
<p> Amid my summer in NYC, I headed to San Francisco for a week. Apple does a conference every year where they reveal all their new software and developer tools called the World Wide Developers Conference, or as in some of their posters, &ldquo;the epicenter of change&rdquo;. I was very fortunate to win a scholarship to attend free of charge; they provide some student scholarships every year. I was again astounded by the talent in this world; 13-year old girls and boys were incredible programmers. When I was in Cancun I knew no one that knew how to program, and I was very happy this conference introduced me to other latinos passionate about creating value through apps. </p>

<h4 id="startup-at-brown">Startup@Brown</h4>
<p>  Over the summer I also lead the organization of Startup@Brown, a weekend-long conference in September that brought together 300 students and startups. I felt the entrepreneurship scene at Brown was catching sparks and I wanted to help through trying to kick off the year by starting a fire. I was part of Hack@Brown and Brown EP and decided to organize this conference collaboratively. The Brown CS Department was also instrumental. As a freshman I went to the fall career fair and there were a lot of big companies, but I felt it wasn&rsquo;t as welcoming for freshmen, and I also didn&rsquo;t see a clear way to apply to startups. I really wanted to feel the rush of working at a VC-backed startup, so through the hackNY Fellowship, I was fortunate to end up interning at a startup in NYC for the summer. I felt Startup@Brown was a great way to expose more students to this thrilling world of startups. I learned immensely from taking the lead in organizing the conference. </p>

<p> I remember the week leading up to the conference was especially tough. Getting on calls, answering emails to all the sponsorship companies, and logistics in general started to ramp up. There was a problem with the students&rsquo; workshop signups that had me and our team manually fixing for over 4 hours. I also had a big Machine Learning homework due on Thursday, a Computer Systems project due that weekend, and a Differential Equations problem set due Friday. That Thursday night was also the start of GORB, when Buxton decides to be a frat each year. The week seemed unsurvivable, but thanks to trying to be more aware, I realized it was all a learning opportunity and that at the end, I would get through it. At the end, I could see the fruits. Feedback from the students and startups put a smile in my face and I knew I had created value. After a survey we learned that around 36% of students that attended got a job offer. More importantly, I helped inspire students to create things of their own and to realize than can too be founders of their own projects. </p>

<h4 id="daycation">Pineapple, Daycation</h4>
<p>That summer I also built a &ldquo;minimum viable product&rdquo; for Pineapple, an app that let&rsquo;s you enjoy hotel pools and amenities for the day without being a guest. My friend Matt from Brown and I started this project right before summer and up to today, I&rsquo;m still working on it. I took a class at Brown where I could work on Daycation (we changed its name) and Matt has taken the full year off Brown to work on it. We&rsquo;ve both learned incredible amounts of things by pushing through walls, which to elaborate would require a post of its own.</p>

<h4 id="books-music-more"> Books, Music, and More</h4>
<p> That summer I also did some things I love and tried some new miscellaneous things.</p>

<p>Books never miss to expand my worldview. That summer I read Einstein&rsquo;s biography, How to Create a Mind, Your Brain at Work, Drive, The Martian, An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, Total Recall (Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s bio), Buyology, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, Powering the Future: how we will solve the energy crisis, Design is a Job, Steal Like an Artist, and Primates and Philosophers.</p>

<p>I like to create things, and that includes music playlists. I released three new 8tracks <a href="http://8tracks.com/valentinp7/mixes/1" target="_blank">playlists</a>, Coconut, Mango, and Lem&oacute;n. Getting comments and likes from people all over the world has made me realize that people from different corners on earth can now bond over interests; simple things like a good song can make people forget about boundaries.   I also tried to start an online personal blog, but only wrote two posts.</p>


<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p> I&rsquo;m ready to continue learning and expanding my worldview. In fact, I&rsquo;d like to do three things: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Live a balanced life mentally, physically, spiritually, and socially.</li>
	<li>Broaden and deepen my worldview and everyone else's as much as possible. Cultivate &quot;Collective Enlightenment&quot;, helping me and everyone be more conscious and aware. </li>
	<li>Create the most value I can, always thinking the biggest I can. The biggest I currently think is creating the most value ever.</li>
</ul>
