					<h1>Approach</h1>
					<p>This is an endeavor into writing how my worldview has changed over the course of my life, even though it&rsquo;s impossible to encompass everything in words.</p>
					<a href="#rhinos">go to rhinos</a>
					<p>I wrote this for a class at Brown, “The Shaping Of Worldviews”, but most importantly, to gain more self-awareness, and thus, for me. </p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s structured as a brief history of key moments and contexts in my life. Throughout the essay, I mention specific perspectives, that when clicked, expand into <a href="../perspectives/index4.html" target="blank">generalized viewpoints.</a></p>

					<h1>Path and Contexts</h1>
					<p>I first have to start by saying I’m extremely grateful for the circumstances of my life. I'm aware I’ve been exceptionally lucky to have been born completely healthy, into a supporting and loving family, and with access to opportunities. </p>
					<p>I don’t understand why I’ve been given the chance to carve this path in life, but I will do the best I can to live a life of use. I think <a href="../perspectives/index4.html#short-big-life" target="_blank">my life is short but I won't let it be small</a>. When things get tough, I realize I’m still an extremely fortunate person. I also see hardships as an opportunity to learn; I think trying to be more aware and conscious is the most important goal for self-improvement. My motivation is gratitude paired with a drive to make a difference. </p>
					<br>
					<h2>Family Shaping</h2>
					<p>Since I can remember, I’ve been excessively curious. I always poke around, ask, experiment, learn, and make, just to figure out the why of things. I would bombard my dad with hows and whys all the time, and I would always ask my mom for the reasoning behind things like why I had to share. I would never, ever settle with a “because I said so”.</p>

					<p>This was in part because my dad has always told me to never believe everything people say, including himself. He inculcated in me that although it&rsquo;s important to be open-minded, information should be filtered, and ultimately, I have to think for myself. I still ask him for recommendations on random things, but he usually comes back with &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me, do what you want&rdquo;. I love hearing people&rsquo;s perspectives and suggestions, but when I ask my dad I&rsquo;m always reminded that the person who knows most what I really want is myself. And that&rsquo;s another thing he&rsquo;s taught me: to do what I want to do, and that I can do so because I&rsquo;m literally the captain of my life.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s probably true for many people, but the two people that have influenced me the most are my parents, Gloria and Alejandro. </p>
					<p>My mom radiates happiness and love. She&rsquo;s one of the most grateful people I know and she always finds the good side of events and people. In my family we always say that &ldquo;she would lift up a rock to say hi to a cricket&rdquo;; she immediately connects with people and loves social events. I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;ve biologically inherited some of her characteristics; being able to easily connect with people has been extremely rewarding. And throughout life, she&rsquo;s also taught me to be empathetic, grateful, and self-aware. </p>

					<p>My mom has taught me to be friends with everyone; to always be nice and kind to people, because we don&rsquo;t know everyone&rsquo;s story and what they&rsquo;ve been through. Plus, friends are always helpful down the road. She&rsquo;s helped me understand that even if we don&rsquo;t agree with someone, we should try to understand them.</p>
					<p>
					But she&rsquo;s demonstrated to me that in life it&rsquo;s also important spice things up.</p>
					<blockquote>Being shrewd, perceptive, and quick-witted is critical to get what you want. </blockquote>



					<p>When I was around 11 years old, I loved playing with Beyblades (popular spinning tops at the time). We were in Canada and I knew there was a Beyblade competition so I told my parents to take me. When we got there, I had to enter my name in a raffle for a chance to participate. Since in my ID I had Valentin Matias Perez (my middle name is Matias), my mom told me to enter my name twice, one with Valentin and one with Matias. My family had always fun-teased me that I was &ldquo;justo recto&rdquo; (meaning I was all about justice and fairness), so I didn&rsquo;t want to write Matias. I wasn&rsquo;t happy but my mom ended up convincing me and we wrote both of my names. When they started calling out the names of the lucky few that could participate, I heard &ldquo;Matias Perez&rdquo;. I immediately ran and said that was me. I was super excited that I could compete, and I realized it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if it wasn&rsquo;t for my mom&rsquo;s sharpness. There are countless other situations where my mom has taught me to be savvy and now I pay special attention to find opportunities around me. </p>

					<p> My mom has a super-natural power to catch lies and understand why people do things. She&rsquo;s also one of the most sharp-eyed people I know. I think I&rsquo;m not good at lying because my mom would always see behind what I said. Although as a little kid it was frustrating sometimes, I learned to be honest. </p>

					<p>She also has an incredibly positive outlook on life. &ldquo;La vida es plena, perfecta, y completa&rdquo; is one of the phrases I hear my mom repeating all the time. It means life is full, perfect, and complete. She says we attract what we say and think, and every time something good or bad happens, she repeats the phrase. When it&rsquo;s something good it&rsquo;s to be grateful of what just happened, and when it&rsquo;s something bad it&rsquo;s to make us realize this is a learning opportunity or that something better awaits us. She is currently taking online courses and getting certificates to be a Lifestyle &amp; Health Coach; she wants to help other women love themselves and she believes she can do this through coaching on nutrition, image &amp; style, and wellness.</p>

					<p> My mom didn&rsquo;t go to college. She married my dad when she was 19 years old and my dad dropped out of college on his second year; I was born within the year. And it&rsquo;s crazy to think I&rsquo;m already over with my second year of college. One of the persons I look up to the most is my dad, and not only because he&rsquo;s my dad. My father was studying civil engineering in Colombia (the country) and although he was in Honor Roll, he realized it wasn&rsquo;t what he really liked. He dropped out and essentially became an entrepreneur. His dad wasn&rsquo;t happy he dropped out so he gave him just a little bit of money to survive but said to not come back asking for more; he&rsquo;d have to figure it out on his own. My dad worked at several places including in a factory packaging underwear and he also started several businesses like importing and selling Korean truck tires. He would tell my mom that they would live under a bridge if they had to, but to believe that he would find a way out. They never lived under a bridge. Several small projects, businesses, and real estate deals after, my dad decided to endeavor into the stock market. He had always been fascinated by the investing world but everyone had always told him &ldquo;that&rsquo;s too hard&rdquo;. And well, my dad likes hard things. He learned through devouring books and taking online seminars. Reading is his favorite pastime; I see him reading all the time. He&rsquo;s been learning and practicing trading for over 15 years now; and after ups and downs he now has his own hedge fund. </p>

					<p>Apart from setting an example to me on working hard, doing what you love, and thinking big, my father has taught me countless life lessons.</p>

					<p>Sometimes he would straight up tell me to act and think with probabilities because that&rsquo;s how the world works, or to be a producer more than a consumer, or to be antifragile, or to always create value.</p>

					<p>Other times he would tell me short stories to illustrate a point. He once told me a story about a guru and a man that wanted to be successful. The wise guru was meditating at the border of a fountain in his monastery and the man walked up to him. &ldquo;Guru, how can I be successful?&rdquo;, the man asked. The guru grabbed the man&rsquo;s face and shoved it into the water. The man tried to get out but the guru didn&rsquo;t let him; the guru pressed down hard and didn&rsquo;t let the man breathe. The man shook and tried pushing up violently but it was futile up until the guru finally let the man&rsquo;s head out of the water. Startled, the man asked &ldquo;Why did you do that?!&rdquo;. The guru replied, &ldquo;When you were under water, what did you want?&rdquo;. My father asked this to me too. &ldquo;I wanted to breathe!&rdquo;. The guru smiled and said &ldquo;in order to be successful, you&rsquo;ve got to want it as bad as you wanted to breathe when I had you underwater&rdquo;. </p>

					<p>And some other times his life lessons came in the form of challenges. I loved being challenged. The challenges weren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;I dare you to jump off a bridge&rdquo; type; their purpose was to become better at something or to try a new thing.</p>

					<p>My father once challenged me to show him in three months that I could do 100 soccer juggles (keeping the ball in the air by kicking it 100 times). My friends who were really good at soccer had records of around 100 to 150 juggles. No joke, my record was 3. So I didn&rsquo;t miss a single day of going out to my backyard and kicking the ball up for at least an hour, apart from my soccer practice. Two weeks in and I thought 100 juggles would be impossible. My record was 9 and it was still very, very troublesome to lift the ball from the ground with my feet. The three months passed and I showed my dad how many I could do. My father was not surprised when I reached the 100 count &mdash; he had actually expected me to complete his dare. But he was astounded when I went way beyond; I ended up doing 396. Even when I was confident I could achieve his challenge of 100 juggles, I kept practicing, improving and getting out of my comfort zone every day. I wanted to give more than what he had expected. At the time I wasn&rsquo;t aware, but this was one of the clearest instances where I subconsciously learned that a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept. </p>

					<p>Mastering how to juggle a soccer ball didn't actually help me score, pass or run during a soccer game, but the process taught me that if I'm resourceful, work hard, and concentrate, I can accomplish whatever I set my mind to and go beyond. However, a week after the challenge I felt something was missing. I wasn't feeling the enthusiasm of waking up with a goal in mind or the thrill of stretching my limits. Paradoxically, I realized I'm happier with myself when I leave the &quot;comfort&quot; zone. Ever since that challenge, I habitually feel an urge to learn more, to go beyond specifications, and to push through my comfort zone. </p>

					<p>Another challenge from my dad consisted of running and reading The Economist.  The challenge was to: Handwrite minimum page-long summaries of three of The Economist weekly articles, and every word that I didn&rsquo;t know the meaning of (which at that point was around 40% of the words because I was in middle school and because The Economist uses pretty complex language) I would have to look up in the dictionary, write down the definition, and try to learn it.  Run 50km.  Do 1) and 2) every week for 20 weeks.  This challenge was also for my sister and my mom, but I remember I was the only one who completed it all the 20 weeks. After a few weeks I got around convincing my dad that my soccer games on Saturdays could count for 10km and that practices counted for 5km, but he didn&rsquo;t count my tennis practices.  </p>



					<p>Some other times my dad would just take me running. My mom would be worried that I would push myself too hard because she knew I would never give up and that my dad would challenge me to push harder. There was a time when my dad would wake my sister and I up at 4:40am to go running before school. All of this extra running was super helpful for soccer because it would take me a long time to get tired, but it was also a fun time with my dad. My father has always emphasized me how important exercise is. And how important is meditation and being mindful. Both my mom and my dad have shaped my thoughts on how important it is to live a balanced life. </p>

					<p> I think I&rsquo;m a self-learner, self-starter, and an entrepreneur largely because of my dad&rsquo;s influence. He&rsquo;s taught me to be relentlessly resourceful and to be independent. He always asks me &ldquo;eres cabeza de rat&oacute;n o cola de le&oacute;n?&rdquo;; I always answer &ldquo;cabeza de rat&oacute;n&rdquo; or sometimes &ldquo;cabeza de le&oacute;n&rdquo; just to tease him. My dad has given me a huge hunger for learning and making a difference, while always reminding me the importance of humility. He regularly asks me: &ldquo;so, are you going to be a game-changer?&rdquo;</p>

					<p>I also don&rsquo;t know anyone else that can focus on things as much as my dad. My mom, sister, and I can talk literally in front of him about him when he&rsquo;s working on his computer and he won&rsquo;t realize what we just said. It&rsquo;s probably about how amazing he is at cooking or drawing. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve found a restaurant that tastes as good to me as my dad&rsquo;s signature dishes. He cooks a rack of lamb with mint jelly that is unparalleled &mdash; my dad is very attentive to details and he applies that to almost everything he does. Yet another thing I&rsquo;ve learned through him is that excellence is a habit. </p>

					<p>My parents were both raised in catholic families, so religion has also had an influence in my worldview. My mom&rsquo;s high school was a convent school. My dad always questions the why of things so as a teenager he read a lot of books on many different religions to understand better why is it that he and his family went to church. So while I was baptised, as I grew up my dad told me that I should choose by myself what to believe in and what to practice, if at all. I did take classes for doing my first communion but it was just to learn more about catholicism. As a family we went to church a couple of Sundays but it was just a couple of Sundays; my parents wanted us to see what it was like. My dad explained to me the purpose of religions in general, how some were formed, and the good and not so necessary parts of some. He didn&rsquo;t really enjoy going to church on Sundays. He says you can believe in a higher being or the universe or however you want to call it without having to go to church. He prefers to meditate, be mindful, and exercise every day. My mom also meditates but does like to go to church every once in a while. My dad says you can also not believe in a higher being and be happy too. He just doesn&rsquo;t like when there&rsquo;s &ldquo;herd&rdquo; mentality; he&rsquo;s taught me to question things, experiment, and be aware, not blind. I&rsquo;m agnostic about the nature of our existence or the possible existence of a higher being, but my &lsquo;spirituality&rsquo; or growth model is stepping up the consciousness staircase.</p>

					<p>I have a sister named Susana, who I call Susy, and a funky little brother named Nicol&aacute;s who I call Pico, Nico, or Picol&aacute;s. </p>

					<p>Since I&rsquo;m only a year and a half older, Susy has been my partner in crime since we were little. We&rsquo;ve done countless pranks, played tennis, and learned together since we were little. So many of my experiences and lessons I&rsquo;ve learned with Susy by my side. She&rsquo;s also given me points of views I sometimes wouldn&rsquo;t have had. She has taught me it&rsquo;s okay to say no to things; in fact, it&rsquo;s okay to say no a lot. Like my dad, she&rsquo;s also taught me the importance of thinking for myself. She has a strong character and her friends love her I think because of her originality and independence. </p>

					<p>Up to this day, my sister and I still continue with two &ldquo;inside&rdquo; challenges when we were very little. When we were around 6 and 4.5 years old there was a time we were travelling as a family in Paris and one day as we got out of the shower, I remember we both said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold&rdquo;. We argued who was colder for a while. When we were little we had super long arguments that usually turned into fights. We continued saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still cold&rdquo; for days, even when it was clearly hot. Up until today we sometimes slip out &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still cold&rdquo;. We do the exact same thing with saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still on 2&rdquo;. We once were trying to see who could count faster and then we decided to see who could count slower. It became a slow race to count to three. We both started with &ldquo;one&rdquo;, and somehow managed to get each other to say &ldquo;two&rdquo;; we were little. Up until today, we&rsquo;re both still on 2. These type of subtle interactions express how long I&rsquo;ve known her and remind me of how many experiences we&rsquo;ve been through together. I have very few friends with similar deep-rooted expressions of connection. </p>

					<p> My little brother is 7 years old and he&rsquo;s shown me how a single person can bring light and happiness to situations. He&rsquo;s the little spark of the family. I&rsquo;m in awe of how outgoing and sociable he is. He&rsquo;s a YouTuber. I get 2-3 notifications in my phone every day of new videos he just uploaded. He&rsquo;s made me realize how much the world has changed and the direction it&rsquo;s going. He likes to build like me but instead of building physical cars or spaceships with Legos, he builds virtual worlds with Minecraft. He likes to share things with the world like me but instead of making paper airplanes or small inventions, he makes YouTube videos. He also really likes to dance and party. He&rsquo;s also helped me be more self-aware of how I was raised because I see him as a reflection of me and what things my parents teach him. I also learn by teaching him to be resourceful and to adopt a growth mindset &mdash; the idea that most abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work; you&rsquo;re not fixed, you can grow through challenges. </p>

					<p> There&rsquo;s many others members of my family that I love and have shaped my views a lot like my grandparents, uncles, and aunts, but I would have to write at least ten more pages about them. </p>

					<h4 id="rhinos">Rhinos</h4>
					<p> My father&rsquo;s favorite animal is the Rhinoceros. His second favorite is the eagle because he loves freedom, but in our family we joke we&rsquo;re a family of Rhinos. We contrast the cows and rhinos in this world. The cows graze in the pasture with the other cows, unwilling to take a chance at success, thinking that success only comes to those who are lucky, or that they just aren't cut out to be successful; many live out their lives in fear or with herd mentality. Then there are the Rhinos. These guys, unlike the cows, take full charge. Focused and unafraid, thick-skinned and unstoppable, they take massive action toward accomplishing their dreams and goals. They understand that success you can see is there for the taking, if only one has the right training, mindset, and work ethic. We ask, are you a cow lying under a tree letting life just happen to you? Or are you a determined, charging Rhinoceros chasing down what you want and running over every obstacle in your way? </p>
